                                Instance segmentation is a computer vision technique that is used to detect and segment individual objects within an image. In this case, the team used instance segmentation to detect different body parts of mosquito species, such as the head, thorax, and abdomen.
                                  Algorithms used Convolutional Neural Networks.
